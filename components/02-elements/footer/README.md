### Rationale
There is currently a single footer variant available throughout SDC.

Additional planned variants include:

- **Transactional**: which will use a reduced set of links as it is within a transaction funnel.
- **Internal service**: which will tailor content to the internal users.
- **Powered by ONS**: the 'transactional' and 'full' footer are also available for badged services where ONS is providing services to external organisations.
