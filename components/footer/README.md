### Rationale
There is currently a single footer variant available throughout SDC.

Additional planned variants include:

- eQ footer: which will use a reduced set of links as it is within a transaction funnel.
- Internal: which will tailor content and styles to the ‘IUI’.

### Research

### Usage
Currently in use in eQ

#### Scope
Global
