## Rationale
Navigation to move across pages from with a main section.

## Usage
This component should be used to allow users to move between pages that are not necessarily at a global/site wide level but are within a specific context and need to be grouped at the same level. 

This component can be implemented with the [main navigation](/components/detail/header-navigation--main) component to give hierarchy to the content within a service. It can however, be used without any parent level navigation as a way to switch across pages of the same type, for example, moving between different views on a survey list (completed, to do, archived etc).

## Implementation
This component should be inserted directly after the `header` component.
