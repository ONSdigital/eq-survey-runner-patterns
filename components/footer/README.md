### Rationale
There is currently a single footer variant available throughout SDC.

Additional variants include:

- **Transactional**: which will use a reduced set of links as it is within a transaction funnel.
- Internal: which will tailor content and styles to the internal users.

### Research
- User testing has revealed a necessity to reduce the number of links in a footer when in a transaction funnel. Links not directly related to the transaction are regarded as a distraction and add potential confusion for users using a link rotor.

### Usage
Currently in use in eQ

#### Scope
Global

#### Dependencies
* `/components/_footer.scss`
* `vars/_colours.scss`
