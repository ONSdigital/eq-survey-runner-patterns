### Overview

A message list is created from a logical series of [message list items](message-list--item).

The messages are displayed in descending date order. Each message is a list item containing a [message](message)

### Status indicator
Currently the message list item uses `(New)` instead of the [status](status) component. This is because when it was tested with users a coloured dot appeared to indicate the availability of 'live chat'.
