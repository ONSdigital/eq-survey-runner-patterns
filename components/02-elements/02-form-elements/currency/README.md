### Rationale
Currencies are localized for 'en_GB'.

### Variants
Adding currencies is done in the currency.config.js by adding variants.

### Collated
All currencies are collated onto one page.

### Context
Currencies consist of two context items; label and currency.

### Label
Label is the full name of the currency and 3 letter code in brackets and
must be human readable.

### Unit
Currency is the localized symbol for each unit.

### Scope
Global
