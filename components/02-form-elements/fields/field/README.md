### Basic Field

A 'field' wraps the various form inputs and provides context for layoutâ€”it has no visible styling.

## Variants

### Toggle

A smaller field designed as a UI element, rather than a question, eg. toggle for passwords. This field does not use the enhanced focus styling of regular fields.

### Field with checkbox

Automatially includes "Select all that apply" to discourage authors using the `legend` for this.

### Legend

Optional legend to describe a group of inputs.
