### Rationale
Panels are used to draw information to the attention of the user.

#### Default
This panel is used to provide information in a neutral context.

#### Error
Used to provide feedback to the user that something is in an error state. This can range form input validation errors to server downtime.

Content should be descriptive of the error and __always__ direct the user towards a resolution.

#### Success
Success panels are used to provide positive, reassuring feedback to the user.

#### Warning
Warning panels are to draw the attention of the user to information before an error state occurs. The message should be succinct, descriptive and provide sufficient detail to the user to avoid an error state.

#### Spacious variants
Use of the `.panel--spacious` class provides increased padding for `simple` variants.
