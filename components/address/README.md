## Address
This pattern has now been deprecated. 

The `uppercase` and reduced `font-size` styling is no longer a requirement for displaying addresses. 

It should be replaced within services using `<p>` tags and any relevant utility classes.

The styling will be removed in a future release (v2.0) of the pattern library. The .scss for address has been left in situ to avoid breaking changes at this time.
