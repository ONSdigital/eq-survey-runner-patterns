### Rationale
Buttons are used to direct the user to perform a specific interaction. The copy used on the button should be clear, concise and direct.

## Variants

#### Primary
The primary button is used for the primary action for the user's context.

#### Large
The large button is used for the primary service level action for the user.

#### Secondary
Secondary buttons are used for supplementary actions available to the user.

#### Bordered
Bordered buttons should be used for supplementary actions which users can take. They should not compete with the primary action of the context.

#### Link
The link button is used for tertiary actions which act as either navigation (for example 'Previous' in a service process) or as an action which is to take the user from the current context.

#### Disabled
The disabled state is used when other actions must be completed before this action can be made.

### Research

### Usage
The primary, large button is used throughout the eQ survey process as it is the primary action for the user to proceed. The copy used would be "Start survey" then "Save" on each answer submission.
