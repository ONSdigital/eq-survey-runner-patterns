title: Playing back respondent data
---
There are currently 3 methods within an EQ survey for playing back respondent data. Each method allows the respondent to check what they have have previously entered and confirm that the data is correct.

1. The playback of a singular answer
2. The playback of multiple answers or a list of options
3. The playback of answer(s) within a summary

## 1. The playback of a singular answer
Here is an example where the respondent is required to confirm a single answer in order to progress:

![The playback of a singular answer]({{path '/assets/img/playback-singular-answer.png'}})

## 2. The playback of multiple answers or a list of options
Here is an example where the respondent is required to confirm multiple answers or a list of options previously entered:

![The playback of multiple answers]({{path '/assets/img/playback-multiple-answers.png'}})

## 3. The playback of answer(s) within a summary
Here is an example where the respondent has completed a section or survey and their answers are played back within a summary:

![The playback of answer within summary]({{path '/assets/img/playback-summary.png'}})
